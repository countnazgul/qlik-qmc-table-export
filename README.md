# Export Qlik QMC table as csv

Small `Chrome` / `Edge (Chromium)` extension that can export `Qlik Sense` management console (`QMC`) tables to csv file

For example the following table in QMC:

![QMC](./screens/qmc.png)

Will be exported as:

![export](./screens/export.png)

## Status

As far as I can see it's working. More tests have to be performed


## Qlik Version
Tested with `Qlik Sense June 2020`
